# spot-game
Making a short followspot game, using mainly JavaScript but will perhaps branch out.

Premise: You are a followspot operator, following people acround the screen. Aim is to keep the person in the target.

Things I Want to Accomplish: improve background, have a sprite you can follow, points for keeping them in the centre (?)
